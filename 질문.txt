1) best project?
The best project I have is  to write a Windows Display device driver for Accelerator Graphic chip when I was in Samsung Electronics.
This project have lasted for almost 7 years, and  was very big .  I have used a MASM assembly , C / C++, MFC with windwos DDK. 
My pride is the product of this project was launched on Graphic Card Market several times.

Speaking one more, I like to list-up PDA-Chip project .
My roles were to develop the device driver of USB, Camera for PDA-Chip on realtimes OS and windows USB Drvier to play a picture on PC .
Main CPU of this project was ARM7.

2) Why should we hire you?
I like to briefly introduce my history as an Embedded / Firmware Engineer for more than 15 years.

To be more specific,
1)I have developed   Windows Display Device Driver and BIOS when I joinded  Samsung Electronics Graphic Accelerator SOC team 
 (about 10 years).
 
2) At SynerTek Korea PDA SOC development 
  I have developed USB Storage Device Driver and Camera Device Driver for RealTime OS, and 
  USB Device Driver for Windows OS (Over two years)
  
3) As a Bluetooth Stack Leader in Motorola Korea
  I participated in the development of phone for Korea. (1,5 years)
  and I have developed lot of device driver such as LCD, NOR flash memory, PMIC etc .

4) At LG Electronics
  I was Feature Phone S / W development Project Leader for Verizon Wireless (over 2 years)
  Currently, I am responsible for the reliability of DDR, eMMC, and UFS Memory products. (Over 4 years)
  
Especially,I have tested the eMMC/UFS of five vendors (SK Hynix, Samsung, Toshiba, Sandisk, and Micon) for the reliability, 
I have issued a permission to pass / fail to produce.

If I list up any additional experiences I have,
Statistically accessible (currently available with Six Sigma MBB),
Data Mining is available (SQL (2 years), Python (6 years)),
and I can automate any functions. (Deep Learning (1.5 years), MFC (10 years))

If you have questions about me , ask  my previous manager "YoungLee" with email "youngleeemail@gmail.com"

Finally I am confident that I can meet any requirement from you .

Why should we hire you?

silicon gears have four service 
  1. Logging system
  2. Automotive Ethernet : CAN, LIN, FlexRay
  3. ADAS system 
  4. Automotive Security 
  
  I can do implement the driver for CAN,LIN,FlexRay,
  and I do  Board bring-up, and  upload the realtime OS "vxWorks,QNX, Integrity, Linux Kernel" additoin to AUTOSAR
  
  I was embedded / firmware engineer for over 15 years .
  So I can contribute to silicon gear .

What's your expected salary range?

I don't know a living cost in spain , and don't konw the average engineer wage in spain  . 
I will follow your modest guide line .

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why are you going to move ? 

Fourth Generation Induestry revolution is comming or alread started.  
the main core feature is AI, Autonomous vehicle, IOT, robot engineering, 3D technology.
In addition I also  want to particiate in this revolution.
and I search the leading company, and applied to silicom gear .

recently I start to study Deep Learning, and programm Deep Learning algorithm with Python language for almost 2 years .


as second reason, I like to Europe.

What challenges are you looking for in this position?
-->  how you would like to be able to
effectively utilize your skills and
experience if you were hired for the job

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Have you ever had a conflict with a boss or professor? How was it resolved?

Note that if you say no, most interviewers
will keep drilling deeper to find a conflict.
The key is how you behaviourally reacted to
conflict and what you did to resolve it.
For example: “Yes, I have had conflicts in
the past. Never major ones, but there have
been disagreements that needed to be
resolved. I've found that when conflict
occurs, it helps to fully understand the other
person’s perspective, so I take time to listen
to their point of view, and then I seek to
work out a collaborative solution. For
example . . .”
Focus your answer on the behavioural
process for resolving the conflict and
working collaboratively.

-> 없다고 말하지 마라. 그런 경우 더욱 더 파고 들 것이다. 

-> 담배피는 사람을 싫어한다. 냄새가 많이 나서 smoker에게 내 애로를 애기했지만 해결되지 않았다. 
   그래서  나는 다른 자리로 옮겼다.
--> 다른 하나는  사용 중인 서버가 노이즈를 많이 냈다. 그래서  매니저에게 애기해서  방을 만들고, 
   소리 나는 장비를 한 곳으로 모았다.

Silicon Gear
4 industry is comming to us .
silicon gear is witnessing the doubld revolution. 
To be specific, ADAS , Electric Car, Internet in Car will change  world in mobility.

so silicon gear will provide 
software integration services and consulting in the field of automotives

1. Data Logging
    The complexity of cars is increasing
    it increasingly difficult to locate errors and faults.
    it is necessary to have full traceability and logs for  analyzing the errors later.
   --> We have a multiplatform system for the real time acquisition of data for vehicles 
 
2. Next Generation Automotive Ethernet.
    the solution is CAN, LIN, FlexRay  which is standard specification 
    --> need development of CAN, LIN, FlexRay
    
3. ADAS ( Advanced Driver Assistance Systems ) : sensro , GPS, video is included in system to assit driver for safefy and Convenience
    With the introduction of ADAS in automobiles
    the complexity of ECUs is growing exponentially
    necessary to introduce multiple microcontrollers, along with new operating systems such as VxWorks, QNX, Integrity or Linux, in addition to AUTOSAR.
    
    Service Range : 
    board bring-up, driver development
    
4. Automotive Security 
    ADAS and Ethernet is connected  a car to the Internet,
    soon connect to their surroundings vehicle attack vectors grow exponentially,
    
    Service Range : 
    consulting  to implement protection strategies against attacks using common method .
