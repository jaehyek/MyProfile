Dear Hire Manager.  

I am Jaehyek Choi, currently working for LG Electronics.

I have developed the eMMC device driver for Android phone, and tested the eMMC and UFS components by creating a system 
which was composed of two BSP , one is interface board, another is core board to test components.
The Target Test Item is  the sanity of FTL ( Flash Translation Layer ).

I have Issued a certificate to vendors and allowing the part to apply to the products.
In addition, new test items are updated through reproducibility and analysis of defects in the field.
The vendors that contact me are Samsung, SK hynix, SanDisk, Toshiba, and Micron.

I have been doing this for over four years.
I am confident that this experience will help your business.

Additionally I have developed Windows Display Device driver for a graphic accelerator chip which has  a PCI bus.
so I can also develop the SSD Device with PCI bus .

Other than that, please refer to my other resume through my resume.

Thank you
