Dear Hire Manager.  

I am Jaehyek Choi, currently working for LG Electronics.
I have a Six Sigma Master Black Belt certification from LG Electronics. 
I are currently in the quality department, discovering problems that occurred during production, technically and statistically resolving them. 
In particular, I are currently testing memory products (eMMC, UFS) while dealing with product reliability.

I do not know about semiconductor equipment well, but I believe that my design experience when I was in Samsung Electronics will have no difficulty in carrying out necessary tasks 
because I have an understanding of semiconductor process.

The attached history contains several backgrounds for statistical solutions.

For more details, please refer to the enclosed resume.
Thank you
